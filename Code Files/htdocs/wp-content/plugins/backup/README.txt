<h4>A SPECIAL NOTE ON WORDPRESS MIGRATION</h4>

A WordPress site migration is an easy task if performed properly. There are three different migration scenarios:
<ul>
<li>Migrate site from a subdirectory of a domain to the root directory</li>
<li>Migrate site from a local installation to a remote installation</li>
<li>Migrate site between domains or hosts</li>
</ul>

Backup Guard free version will help you migrate your website in case there is no change in the domain or the Database prefix.
If there is any change in the domain or the DB prefix, Backup Guard Pro will be of use.

Backup Guard Pro helps you to migrate in all of the above mentioned three cases in the smoothest possible way. You just have to Backup your site and Restore it in the new location. No additional work will be required, since we handle all changes for you.

The issues that users always deal with are: wrong site URL, images not loading, dashboard not being accessible, permalinks not working and more.

Backup Guard Pro will help you to skip all these problems because of its advanced refactoring and migrating engine.
